# DEX-Work-Sample
This is a sample of a Decentralized Exchange developed as a personal project to show my skills as a Smart Contracts developer. The smart contracts were deveoped using Solidity and we also used javascript, mocha and chai to create some tests. The architecture of the project is based on the Uniswapvs protocol. We implemented the following smart contracts: <br />

Smar Contracts: <br />
1. LiquidityPool: This smart contract represents a generic liquidity pool. <br />
2. PoolFactory: The pool factory manage different liquidity pools. <br />
3. PoolRouter: The router is the contract designed to interact with. It obtain information from pools through the pool factory contract. <br />


Features
Validates tokens with different number of decimals.  
Implements the constant product model of UniswapV2<br />
Swapping of Token to Token  
Swapping of Ether to Token
Fully tested


> [!NOTE]
> Consider that these contracts are not ready for production. It is necessary to add more functionality and testing.
